# **Product Requirements Document: Coverage Hub Web Viewer**

## 1. **Overview / Product Vision**

**Coverage Hub** is a web-based viewer that displays test coverage reports generated by tools like `coverage-runner` and `coverage-analyzer`. It enables users to explore test coverage, code complexity, and category-specific insights **for each open-source repository**.

> *“A searchable hub to audit and understand test strategies at the OSS level.”*

---

## 2. **Background / Problem Statement**

* While CLI tools like `coverage-runner` and `coverage-analyzer` generate detailed reports, they are not suited for **cross-repository** exploration or comparison.
* There is no centralized interface for examining the **test condition and code health** of open-source software.
* Creating a searchable, visual dataset for **LLM and testing tools** requires a platform that organizes this data meaningfully.

---

## 3. **Goals**

* Support registration and visualization of multiple OSS repositories.
* Render structured, styled web pages using `coverage-analyzer` JSON outputs.
* Enable rich metadata (tags, categories, complexity metrics) for **search, sort, and filter** operations.
* Serve as a **contextual dataset** for machine learning and AI tool testing.

---

## 4. **Target Users / Personas**

* **OSS Maintainers** seeking to demonstrate or improve test health.
* **Security/Test Researchers** auditing code quality and practices.
* **AI Tool Builders** using OSS as a benchmark or dataset.
* **Engineering Managers** evaluating open-source contributions.

---

## 5. **Use Cases**

* **UC1:** Registering a GitHub repository auto-generates a coverage visualization page.
* **UC2:** Users can quickly compare complexity levels across repositories or code categories.
* **UC3:** Users can annotate and share contextual insights about an OSS project’s testing strategy.

---

## 6. **Core Features**

### 6.1 Repository Page Registration API

* Accepts JSON reports from CLI tools.
* Includes GitHub repo URL, tags, and metadata.
* Automatically generates an analysis page.

### 6.2 Search, Filter, and Sort Capabilities

* Search by GitHub repo name, tag, or category.
* Sort by coverage percentage, complexity score.
* Filter by language, tag, test strategy maturity, etc.

### 6.3 OSS Verification Pages

* Dedicated page per repository featuring:

  * Overall coverage summary.
  * Coverage distribution by category.
  * List of high-complexity, untested functions.

### 6.4 Sharing and Annotation Tools

* Public URLs for repository pages.
* Markdown badges and social share buttons (e.g., Twitter/X).
* Editable annotation areas for developer commentary.

---

## 7. **Non-Functional Requirements**

* Use of **TypeScript + React**, preferably with **Next.js** (SSR/ISR ready).
* Server must handle JSON ingest via Edge/Cloud infrastructure.
* No sensitive data (e.g., secrets) should be embedded in URLs.
* Design must be responsive and performant across devices.

---

## 8. **Development Roadmap**

| Phase | Milestone                                 |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| P1    | Repository ingestion & page rendering     |
| P2    | Search UI with tag and complexity filters |
| P3    | Markdown badges and social share support  |
| P4    | WebAuth & LLM integration capabilities    |

---

## 9. **Open Questions**

* Should `coverage-runner` CLI directly POST data, or use an intermediate queue?
* What’s the best way to support auto-uploads via PR bots?
* How long should coverage reports be stored? Is expiry needed?

---

## 10. **Feature Expansion: In-Depth Function Analysis**

### 10.1 High-Complexity Function Visualization

* List functions with **cyclomatic complexity ≥ 10**.
* Allow filtering by complexity threshold.
* Highlight risky functions not covered by tests.

### 10.2 Intent & Purpose Annotation

* Allow developers to annotate functions with:

  * Business intent.
  * Implementation background.
  * Historical context (e.g., bug fixes, spec changes).

### 10.3 Test Assurance Mapping

* Show which test cases cover which functions.
* Include:

  * Test file names.
  * Test descriptions (e.g., `should_throw_on_expired_token`).
  * Type of test (unit, integration).
* Visual link to decision paths (e.g., conditionals covered or missed).

### 10.4 Sorting & Prioritization

* Allow sorting by:

  * Complexity
  * Coverage %
  * Uncovered branches
* Highlight **high-risk functions** (high complexity, low/no test coverage).

---

## 11. **Natural Language Code Interpretation (Advanced)**

### Goal

Help users **understand not just that code is complex, but *why***, and whether the test strategy is philosophically sound, using principles by experts like **Vladimir Khorikov** and **t-wada**.

### Interpretive Analysis Includes

* **Why is the code complex?**

  * Business logic (e.g., multi-tenant workflows).
  * Technical limitations (e.g., backward compatibility).
  * Historical layers (e.g., legacy patches).

* **How is it tested?**

  * Whether tests are **behavior-driven**.
  * Boundary, failure, and edge cases.
  * Avoidance of test smells (e.g., overuse of mocks).

* **Is the test strategy effective?**

  * Is the code resilient to change?
  * Are risk areas clearly addressed?
  * Are the tests **specifications in disguise**, or tightly coupled to implementation?

### Example Output

```
Function: validateSessionToken(token)
- Complexity: 12 (multiple branches + external JWT provider)
- Intent: Validates session tokens; supports fallback logic for token refresh.
- Background: Required to support both B2B and B2C auth flows, increasing logic depth.
- Test Strategy:
   - Covers valid and invalid token paths.
   - Handles provider failure scenarios.
- Evaluation: High-complexity function, but tested with behavior-first approach.
  External dependencies are abstracted cleanly. Strategic testing well-implemented.
```

## 12. **Design Philosophy**

* **Clarity over cleverness:** Prioritize understandability and explainability in UI and data presentation.
* **Testing as specification:** Embrace the idea that tests document the intended behavior of the system.
* **Semantic transparency:** Design the data structure and layout to allow LLMs or dev tools to interpret the testing intent and code behavior.
